# Bible Lib

_Note_ This library is unfinished, so use it as a stepping-stone for your own application or wait until a more stable version is out.

## What is this?

A library for interacting with and parsing the data within the bible.

The purpose of this is to work with a large dataset, parse it, and compare data. My goal is to utilize this within a GUI application and for others to be able to do as they with the library.
